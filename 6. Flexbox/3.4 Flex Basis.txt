Lesson 3.4: Flex Basis

* Nothing to add here

# The flex-basis property specifies the initial length of the child element
- A few ways to do that:
% or px
- Can use px as per norm or use % in relation to the length of the parent element

Usage:
<div style="flex-basis: 10px">Hey</div>

<div style="flex-basis: 10%">Hey</div>


# As the name suggests this is the basis of you element thus you should use this to specify the original size of the elements
  - It will grow and shrink from there
  - Thus use this instead of using width when using flexbox as it is more convenient since you can use flex (learnt in the next lesson)
