Lesson 2.8: Perfect Centering

* Once again no changes here
To get perfect centering for your flex items set both justify-content and align-items to center

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

# Makes complete sense since one centers vertically (align items) and one centers horizontally (justify content)
