Lesson 3.1: Child Element

* While there is nothing to add here- child element will see a lot more of the responsive side of flex box
* This is due to the more individualistic nature of the topics discussed

The direct child elements of a flex container automatically become flexible items
# In Lesson 3 we will go through the following flex item properties:

- order
- flex-grow
- flex-shrink
- flex-basis
- flex
- align-self

Since with child element's we are going to be dealing with specific elements- have to style them personally
- Not under style on the top

eg:
<div class="flex-container">
  <div style="order: 3">1</div>
</div>

# Will learn order in the next lesson
