Lesson 3.6: Align Self

* Nothing to add here

# The align-self property allows the user to overwrite the align-items and set a specific one for a child element
# All the possible options are the same as align-items
  - Basically align-self is align-items for a specific element

Usage:
<div style="align-self: center">Hey</div>

# Since this is only applicable to vertical alignment, I tried to find one for horizontal but than realised that 
  probably not work
