Lesson 2.7: Align Content

* Once again, nothing much here just the alignment of flex lines to layout wrap 
* Basically make it look nicer when wrap reacts to change in screen size

The align-content property is used to align the flex lines
- flex-lines are the lines created when you wrap your elements
- There are 7 different ways to align the lines:

1) align-content: stretch;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-wrap: wrap;
                 align-content: stretch;}

- This is the default setting
- Have to flex-wrap to be able to use align-content since you are trying to align the lines created due to wrap
- The stretch value stretches the flex lines to take up the remaining space

2) align-content: space-between;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-wrap: wrap;
                 align-content: space-between;}

- Displays the flex lines with equal space between them

3) align-content: space-around;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-wrap: wrap;
                 align-content: space-around;}

- Displays the flex lines with space before, after and between them

4) align-content: space-evenly;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-wrap: wrap;
                 align-content: space-evenly;}

- Displays the flex lines with equal space before, after and between them

5) align-content: center;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-wrap: wrap;
                 align-content: space-center;}

- Displays the flex lines in the middle of the container

6) align-content: flex-start;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-wrap: wrap;
                 align-content: flex-start;}

- Displays the flex lines at the start of the container

7) align-content: flex-end;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-wrap: wrap;
                 align-content: flex-end;}

- Displays the flex lines at the end of the container
