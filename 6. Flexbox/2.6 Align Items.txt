Lesson 2.6: Align Items

* Since Align Items is the same as justify content just that it is vertical instead of horizontal
* There is nothing much to add here- changing sizes will show the true effect of align items

- align-items property aligns elements on the cross axis. For rows, the main axis is a vertical line and for columns it is a horizontal line.
  - This means that it aligns the elements vertically for rows and horizontally for columns (basically opposite of justify-content)
- Before I start remember you can visualise all of this using the cheatsheet
- This can be done in 5 ways:

1) align-items: stretch;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 align-items: stretch;}

- This is the default setting
- Stretches the flex items to fill the container
- Thus they take up the whole vertical length of the container

2) align-items: center;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 align-items: center;}

- Center aligns the flex items in the middle of the container (vertically only)

3) align-items: flex-start;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 align-items: flex-start;}

- flex-start aligns the flex items to the top of the container (vertically only)

4) align-items: flex-end;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 align-items: flex-end;}

- flex-end aligns the flex items to the bottom of the container (vertically only)

5) align-items: baseline;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 align-items: baseline;}

- baseline aligns the flex items by aligning all the baselines of the elements together
- The baseline of an element is the line on which the text of the element lies on, which usually is the center of the element
