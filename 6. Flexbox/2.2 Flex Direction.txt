Lesson 2.2: Flex Direction

* Nothing I have to add to these notes- this one is really just layout

The flex-driection property defines which direction the container wants to stack the flex items
- There are four possible flex-direction values:

1) flex-direction: row;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-direction: row;}

- This is the default setting if you do not specify which direction you want
- Stacks the flex items horizontally from left to right

2) flex-direction: row-reverse;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-direction: row-reverse;}

- Stacks the flex items horizontally from right to left

3) flex-direction: column;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-direction: column;}

- Stacks the flex items vertically from top to bottom

4) flex-direction: column-reverse;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-direction: column-reverse;}

- Stacks the flex items vertically from bottom to top
