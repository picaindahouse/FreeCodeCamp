# Lesson 1: CSS Flexbox

- I basically completed the rest of the notes before doing this one- oh how I wish I completed this one first

- I thought flexbox was a layout design tool, which while partially true- does not tell its real use
  - It acts as a responsive layout tool: meaning that it dictates how the website will look based on the difference in screen
  - It decides whether an element will remain big when the screen is smaller or shrink to accomodate the smaller screen size

- Thus while I will now go on and attempt to rectify my mistake and give a bit more insight into my notes with regards to flexbox's true capabilites
  - Try to read the following notes with what I have said in mind to understand the true greatness of flexbox

- * Star represent notes from the me who is coming in to rectify the notes from layout to responsive layout

- Also you wish to visualise all of the layout described here just use the cheatsheet I have bookmarked or go to WS3 for actual hands on experience
