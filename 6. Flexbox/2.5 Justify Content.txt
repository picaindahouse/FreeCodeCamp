Lesson 2.5: Justify Content

* While this too is mostly a layout chapter- justify content does have an element of responsiveness to it
* When the screen gets too big- you will get to see the true effects of flex-start/flex-end and the difference between space-around and space-between

The justify-content property is used to align the flex items
- Before I start remember you can visualise all of this using the cheatsheet
- justify-content property aligns elements on the main axis. For rows, the main axis is a horizontal line and for columns it is a vertical line.
  - This means that it aligns the elements horizontally for rows and vertically for columns
- This can be done in 6 ways:

1) justify-content: flex-start;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 justify-content: flex-start;}

- This is the default setting
- Aligns the flex items at the beginning of the container

2) justify-content: flex-end;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 justify-content: flex-end;}

- Aligns the flex items at the end of the container

3) justify-content: center;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 justify-content: center;}

- Aligns the flex items at the center of the container

4) justify-content: space-around;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 justify-content: space-around;}

- Aligns the flex items with space before, between and after the lines

5) justify-content: space-between;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 justify-content: space-between;}

- Aligns the flex items with space between the lines

6) justify-content: space-evenly;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 justify-content: space-evenly;}

- Aligns the flex items with space before, between and after the lines
- However, where in space-around the space is only equal between adjacent elements
  - In space-evenly the space is equal between adjacent elements and before the first element and after the last element
