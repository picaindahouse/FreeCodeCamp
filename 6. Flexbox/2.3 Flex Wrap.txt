Lesson 2.3: Flex Wrap

* So as I have said in my first lesson- flexbox deals with responsive layout (how the layout reacts to change in screen size)
* Wrap is a very powerful technique to help a website's layout react to changes in screen size
* What does wrap even mean?
  - Basially it controls whether a property is single-line or multi-line
    - Thus if nowrap:
      - The child elements will always be in one line, so if the screen size
        shrinks the user will not be able to see the whole line

    - If wrap
      - The child elements will adjust and become multi-lined based on screen size
      - Thus the elements could be in a single line on a laptop but have the lines 
        on a phone

The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flex item should wrap or not
- There are three possible flex-wrap values

1) flex-wrap: nowrap;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-wrap: nowrap;}

- This is the default setting
- Specifies that the flex items will not wrap

2) flex-wrap: wrap;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-wrap: wrap;}

- Specifies that the flex items will wrap if necessary

3) flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;

.flex-container {display: flex;
                 flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;}

- Specifies that the flex items will wrap if necessary in reverse order
  - If all the elements can fit in a single line then they will be in the original order
  - However, if the elements have to wrap into multiple lines
       - Then, they will do so in reverse
