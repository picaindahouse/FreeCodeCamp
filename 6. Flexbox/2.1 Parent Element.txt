Lesson 2.1: Parent Element

The parent element is the element in which all of the elements you wish to layout reside 

To start using flexbox you have to first define the flex container (the parent element)

Very simple way to define the flex container, add display: flex; in css/ <style>

<style>
  .flex-container {display: flex;}
</style>

<html>
  <div class="flex-container">
    <div>1</div>
    <div>2</div>
    <div>3</div>
  </div>
</html>

# In the above scenario the <div> with the class "flex-container" is the parent
# The other three <div> are the child elements

# There are a few flex properties that can be used to create the ideal layout to you
# In Lesson 2 we will go through the following flex-container properties:

- flex-direction
- flex-wrap
- flex-flow
- justify-content
- align-items
- align-content
