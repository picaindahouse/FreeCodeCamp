Lesson 3.5: Flex

* Nothing to add here

# flex acts as a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis

<div style="flex: 0 0 200px">3</div>

SAME AS

flex-grow: 0 flex-shrink:0 flex-basis: 200px
in that order

# Have to specify the first 2- just put 0 if you don't want it to grow or shrink
# If you don't specify flex-basis it will just take the default length
# Really useful since you can specify the size of the element and how much it will grow and shrink in one line
