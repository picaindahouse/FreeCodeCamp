Lesson 3.2: The Order Property

* No changes here- just the order that elements will be displayed in

Reminder: Since with child element's we are going to be dealing with specific elements- have to style them personally
- Not under style on the top but rather directly in the tag itself

# Order property specifies the order of the flex items

<div class="flex-container">
  <div style="order: 3">Tom</div>
  <div style="order: 1">Dick</div>
  <div style="order: 2">Hairy</div>
</div>

# In the above scenario despite the order that they are written down in being- tom dick hairy
  - It will be read as Dick Hairy Tom

# As you can see to apply flexbox to child element's have to directly style at the element
  - <div style="___"><div>
  - In the case of order:
    - <div style="order: 1"></div>
