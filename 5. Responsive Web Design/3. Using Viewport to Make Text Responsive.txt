Lesson 3: Using Viewport to Make Text Responsive
- We have learnt 2 types of units: fonts and relative
- Well there is a special type of relative unit: Viewport (v)

Viewport refers to the users screen and thus the unit size is relative to the users screen size

Four different viewport units:
- vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
- vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
- vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
- vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).

Should be quite useful to make text be able to fit most screens
