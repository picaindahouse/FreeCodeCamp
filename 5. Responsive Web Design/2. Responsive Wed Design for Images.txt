<!-- Lesson 2: Responsive Web Design for Images
- Can use media queries for more complicated scenarios, but to simply resize the image to fit the screen:
  - One can just use auto

Made this htmlable so that I can try out later
- But basically by doing the following any image will fit the screen:
.responsive-img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
- Set max-width to 100% to ensure that the width does not exceed the screen
- Set height to auto as this would mean that the images height will automatically react to it's width
- That is why for a more complicated change, should use media as you can only play around with % in this method

<style>
.responsive-img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

img {
  width: 600px;
}
</style>

<!-- For images that are not looking sharp enough do to high resolutions- just halve it's dimensions -->
