Lesson 1: Creating a Media Query
- Not the first time we are dealing with media queries (CSS Lesson 21)

The word for word description I gave for media queries in CSS:
Media queries is a CSS3 module allowing content rendering to adapt to conditions such as screen resolution. 

This basically means that you can set conditions which when met react differently
eg: If the screen is smaller than a certain size then all the sizes decrease

How to apply:
@media(condition){What happens when condition is met}

There are many conditions you could create:
- max-height: 200px;
- max-width: 300px;

Basically media queries work like if statements
- if condition is met than _____

Thus can use this to make one's website responsive
- Create your website for small/ big screen
- Then create responses to screen sizes which differs greatly from original screen the site was created on

If your website looks fine until max-width: 800px
- Then create a media query for width more than 800px, where everything increases
- eg: say original font-size: 10px;

<style>
  @media (min-width: 800px;) {p {font-size: 20px;}}
</style>

# Note
- As you can see above, you have to specify which element's size you are changing 
- If you want to change for all either use inheritance by targeting the highest element
  or create a class for all elements you wish to change and then apply the changes to the class
