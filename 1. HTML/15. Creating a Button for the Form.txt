<!-- Lesson 15: Adding a Submit Button to the Form
Now we have the location we wish the data to be sent to and a text field
- We just need to be able to allow the user to submit what he has written into the text field
- For this we create a button and nest in the form function as well 

A button element works like this:
<button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>
- For now since we just wish to submit we will only use type = "submit"
- Nest the button element under the form element

Thus our new form should look something like this:
--> 

<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
