<!-- Lesson 16: Field Validation
Now we have a mini form where a user can write something in the text field
and submit it

However, what if we want the text field to field in before submission?
- Basically cannot submit the field empty

Just add the required attribute to the text field:
<input type="text" required>
- Does not have to equal anything, just write required

Thus if we add this to our current form:
-->

<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
