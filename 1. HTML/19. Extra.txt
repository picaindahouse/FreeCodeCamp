<!-- Lesson 19: Extra

A fast one, if you want the radio options to line up and not be side by side:
- Then add a <br> after each line:
-->

  <label for = "indoor">
    <input id = "indoor" type = "radio" name = "indoor-outdoor">indoor
  </label><br>
  <label for = "outdoor">
    <input id = "outdoor" type = "radio" name = "indoor-outdoor">outdoor
  </label>
