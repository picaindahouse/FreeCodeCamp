<!-- Lesson 20: How to Create a Checkbox
A checkbox is the same as the Radio just that you can choose more than one option:
- Radio: Can choose only one option
- Checkbox: Can choose multiple options

The actual coding is very similar to radio, with just one difference,
- type = "checkbox" instead of "radio"

Below you can see the three types of input we have added to our form
- radio, checkbox, text
-->

<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <label for="indoor"><input id="indoor" type="radio" 
   name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
  <label for="outdoor"><input id="outdoor" type="radio" 
   name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>

  <label for = "angry"><input id = "angry" type = "checkbox" 
   name = "personality">Angry</label>
  <label for = "sad"><input id = "sad" type = "checkbox" 
   name = "personality">Sad</label>
  <label for = "crazy"><input id = "crazy" type = "checkbox" 
   name = "personality">Crazy</label>

  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
