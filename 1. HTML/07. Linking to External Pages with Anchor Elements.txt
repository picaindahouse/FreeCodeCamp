<!-- Lesson 7: Linking to External Pages with Anchor Elements
Say you want to have the words cat photos link you to another website:

<a href=" http://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a>
- href links to the link
- cat photos is what the user would see and need to press

The format therefore is something like this:
<a href="link to website">What you want the user to click on</a>

If you want the link to open in a new page then you have add another attribute:
target= "_blank"

<a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a>
-->

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>

  <a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a>
