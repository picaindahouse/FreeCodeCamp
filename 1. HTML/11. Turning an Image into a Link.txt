<!-- Lesson 11: Turning an Image into a Link
Pretty simple, just place the img tag where you would your link

<a href= "#">Cat Photos</a>

Thus replace the Cat Photos with the img tag for the img you want to link:

<img src = "https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

And thus you have turned you image into a link:

<a href= "#"><img src = "https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>
-->
