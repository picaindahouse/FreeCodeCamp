# Lesson 2: Adding the h2 Element
Over this next few notes- we will create a cat photo web app

h1 elements are often used for main headings, while h2 elements 
are generally used for subheadings. There are also h3, h4, h5 
and h6 elements to indicate different levels of subheadings.

Thus:
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

Gives you the title Hellow World with subtitle CatPhotoApp
