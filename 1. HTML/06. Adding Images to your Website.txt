<!-- Lesson 6: Adding images to your website 
To add images to your website you need to use img tag
- img are self closing tags: thus no </img>
- img have two required attributes: src and alt
- src is an attribute where you put the link to your image
- alt is what is to be displayed if the image in the link cannot be found
- Below is the image that we added:

<img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="Image not Found">
- src links to a picture of a cat
- since alt="Image not Found", if cannot find img- will say Image not Found

Note: Since img is put under main: need two spaces again
