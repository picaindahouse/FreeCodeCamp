<!-- Lesson 10: Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph
Want to have a link in the middle of a sentence?

Just add the anchor element within the paragraph:

<p>
  View more cat photos
</p>

and

<a href = "#" target = "_blank">cat photos</a>

To combine the above two, just copy the latter and replace the cat photos
with it

As seen below:
-->

<p>
  View more <a href="#" target="_blank">cat photos</a>
</p>
