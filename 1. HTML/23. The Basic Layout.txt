<!-- Lesson 23: The Basic Layout
Till now we have learnt how to use most of the basic stuff in HTML
However, we have not yet learnt the very basic building blocks of HTML:
- First you start of with informing the browser which version of HTML 
you are using
  - For HTML5, just write: <!DOCTYPE html>
  - DOCTYPE is caps senstitive whereas html is not

- Then your whole code is to be wrapped in a html tag
  - Thus you start with <html> and end with </html>

- Finally before you can begin split everything one more time into:
  - <head>
    - Any markup information goes into head
    - For now we just learn title
    - <title>Is whatever you want to be written on the tab</title>

  - <body> 
    - This is where all the content you wish for the user to see are 
      to be written
    - Basically everything we have learnt till now, goes here
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>
    </title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <main>
      <!-- Everything we have learnt till now goes here -->
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
