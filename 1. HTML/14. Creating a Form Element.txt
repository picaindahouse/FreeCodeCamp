<!-- Lesson 14: Creating a Form Element
Now that we have learnt to create a text field we need to learn how to indicate where the data written in 
the text field should be sent
- Won't be learning how to actually send the data till the next lesson

We will nest our text field into a form element
- Will learn how to create better forms via other methods in the future
- But for now forms are tags in HTML with the attribute action
- action = "/url-to-which-you-wish-to-send-the-link-to"
- form element looks like this:

<form action="/url-to-which-you-wish-to-send-the-link-to"> </form>

Thus to create a form we nest the text field we created in lesson 13 into a form action which sends the form
to "/submit-cat-photo"
-->

<form action="/submit-cat-photo"> <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL"></form>
