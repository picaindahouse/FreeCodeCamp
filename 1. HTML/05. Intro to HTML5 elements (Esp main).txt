# Lesson 5- Intro to HTML5 Elements

The following are all HTML5 elements:
main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section

The above elements give a descriptive structure to your HTML, making
your HTML easier to read and also help with Search Engine Optimization

We will be using main in this example:
The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the 
main content of your page
For stuff under main must have two spaces first

Below I use the main tag to nest two paragraphs inside
In a real case scenario these paragrahs will be considered the main 
content of the page

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<main>
  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

  <p> Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched. </p>
</main>
