<!-- Lesson 18: Creating a Set of Radio Buttons
You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.
- Note: ONLY ONE ANSWER!!!

So to learn how to use radio buttons let us add some to our form
- Give them the option to choose whether the cat photo they upload is taken outdoors or indoors

The exact reasons why we nest input into label or why we use for and id is not very clear to me, but:
- Radio Buttons are a type of input just like text fields
- The following method is the general best way to create radio buttons

So each option will require all this: (first for indoor)

  <label for = "indoor">
    <input id = "indoor" type = "radio" name = "indoor-outdoor">indoor
  </label>

- The for and id will be the same, type will equal radio 
- The middle of the <input> and </label> will be the option
- The name is what will remain the same for all options and tell thewebpage that all of the options are for 
the same question
 
Thus, the next option for outdoor
- Will have for and id = "outdoor"
- type and name will remain the same
- <input ___>outdoor</label>

Therefore, no matter how many options you have as long as the name is the same- they in same radio

This is our form now- see the difference between indoor and outdoor
-->

<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <label for = "indoor">
    <input id = "indoor" type = "radio" name = "indoor-outdoor">indoor
  </label>
  <label for = "outdoor">
    <input id = "outdoor" type = "radio" name = "indoor-outdoor">outdoor
  </label>

  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
