<!-- Lesson 21: Adding a Value Attribute and Checking Boxes by Default
This lesson we will be learning two extra things

There is one more additional attribute that we have to add to our checkboxes and radios: value
- The value attribute is what tells the website what the user ticked actually means
- Thus when the user checks a box named No- by default to the website- this tells it that the user is "on"
- This is because on is the default value when the value attribute is not equated to anything
- This does not really help us- thus we have to set a value attribute to tell the website what checking a box 
actually means
- Usually value = whateever your for and id are
- Thus all the attributes your checkbox/ radio should have are:
- id, type, name, value

Now let us say you want certain boxes to be ticked by default:
- Just add another attribute checked to these
- Just write checked, this attribute does not have to equal anything
- This would mean that the box for the input that has the attribute checked will be checked by default
