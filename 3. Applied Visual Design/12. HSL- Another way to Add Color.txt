Lesson 12: HSL- Another way to Add Color 
We have already learnt RGB and HEX when it comes to declaring colors in HTML
- However, there is one more way to declare colors in HTML/CSS: HSL

Why is there another method?
- hsl is a different game. It’s developed to mimic the way we humans thinks of colors (or the human vision)
 rgb is how computers thinks of colors

While I probably won't be using HSL- I will still go through what it entails:
HSL stands for Hue Saturation Lightness.

Hue is basically the color you want- can choose from 0 to 360 (choose from a color wheel)

Saturation is the amount of gray in a color- fully saturated has 0 and a minimially saturated 
color is almost completely gray. Given in % with 100% being fully saturated

Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) 
to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color.

Below you can see HSL in use to create Green, Cyan and Blue.
<style>

  .green {background-color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%);}
  .cyan {background-color: hsl(180, 100%, 50%);}
  .blue {background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);}

</style>
