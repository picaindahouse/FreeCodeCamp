Lesson 5: Animation of Multiple Elements at Variable Rates

Let us say there are multiple elements going through the same animation
- Eg: Having multiple circles "blink"
- Let us say there are multiple circles which have the exact same animation
  - This would mean that they go through the same animation at the same time
  - But what do we then do if we want to vary the timing
    - Meaning that the one cirlce "blinks" first and the other one "blinks" instead of blinking together

There are two ways to vary the animation of multiple elements
- Change the % at which the animation happens
- Change the animation-duration of the animation

CHANGE %
- The example below has two elements going through the same animation
  - However, they vary in timing as one undergoes animation at 50% and the other at 20%

  @keyframes twinkle-1 {
    50% {
      transform: scale(0.5);
      opacity: 0.5;
    }
  }

  @keyframes twinkle-2 {
    20% {
      transform: scale(0.5);
      opacity: 0.5;
    }
  }

CHANGE ANIMATION-DURATION
- While the first method changes the % in keyframes, in this method we change the animation-duration at the original style
  - In the example below the first element has a duration of 1s and the other has a duration of 2s
  - In this scenario both have a percentage of 20%

  .star-1 {
    margin-top: 15%;
    margin-left: 60%;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-name: twinkle;
  }

  .star-2 {
    margin-top: 25%;
    margin-left: 25%;
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-name: twinkle;
  }
