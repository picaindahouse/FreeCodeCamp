Lesson 4: Animation Iteration Count

animation-iteration-count is the fourth property that we will be looking at
- Allows you to decide how many times the animation will be repeated
- animation-iteration-count: 1; means 1 time
- animation-iteration-count: infinite; means infinite times
  - This is how you make your animation repeat continuously 

Eg:

<style>

  #ball {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    animation-name: color;
    animation-duration: 4s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  }

  @keyframes color{
    0% {
      background-color: red;
    }
    50% {
      background-color: yellow;
    }
    100% {
      background-color: purple;
    }
  }

</style>
<div id="ball"></div>

# The above will cause the square to change from red to yellow to purple forever on a loop
# Interesting thing to add on in relation to pseudo elements
  - When you create :before and : after pseudo elements they automatically inherit the same animation as the original element
