Lesson 2: Use CSS Animation to Change the Hover State of a Button

We have already covered how to change the color of an element when you hover over it
- But we can take it to the next level by adding keyframes to the equation
- You can make the element become smaller/bigger, a different shape, etc

Below you will see a combination of :hover and keyframes at work to make a button change color when you hover over it

<style>
  button {
    border-radius: 5px;
    color: white;
    background-color: #0F5897;
    padding: 5px 10px 8px 10px;
  }

  button:hover {
    animation-name: background-color;
    animation-duration: 500ms;
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;
  }
  @keyframes background-color {
    100% {background-color:#4791d0; }
  }


</style>

<button>Register</button>

# So just go directly to 100% 
# We get to see a new property- animation-fill-mode: explained in detail in Lesson 0
