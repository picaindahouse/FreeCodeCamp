Lesson 3: Using Keyframes to Move and Fade Elements
We can use the Keyframes to Move and Fade Elements
- Lets look at them seperately

MOVE
- Quite simple really, just change the location of the element at 0%, 50%, 100%
  - Create a {} for each percentage
  - Below I create a new color and a new location for 0%, 50% & 100%

  @keyframes rainbow {
    0% {
      background-color: blue;
      top: 0px;
      left: 0px;
    }
    50% {
      background-color: green;
      top: 50px;
      left: 25px;
    }
    100% {
      background-color: yellow;
      top: 0px;
      left: -25px;
    }
  }

FADE
- Quite simple really, just use the opacity to make it seem like the element fades
  - Below I made it such that for the duration specified: at the 50%, the element moves to the left and fades
  - When you just put a single percentage, like 50%
    - It goes from original to 50% to back to normal 

  @keyframes fade {
    50% {
      left: 60%;
      opacity: 0.1;
    }
  }
