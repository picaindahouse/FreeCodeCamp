Lesson 1: Using @keyframes
One can use keyframes to animate their site

Their are 8 different properties of keyframes you can use to animate, going through 2 today:
- animation-name: used to identify which animation rules are for which element
- animation-duration: how long the animation will last

APPLICATION
A keyframes with animation-name and animation-duration will look something like this:

<style>
  #tom {
    animation-name: cool;
    animation-duration: 4s;
  }

  @keyframes cool {
    0% {background-color: blue;}
    50% {background-color: green;}
    100% {background-color: yellow;}
  }

  div {
    height: 40px;
    width: 70%;
    background: black;
    margin: 50px auto;
    border-radius: 5px;
  }
</style>

<div> id= "tom"></div>

# So what is going on here?
- The above creates an animation where a rectangle changes color from blue to green to yellow over a 4s time period
- First you create the animation-name and animation-duration in the id of an element
- Then create the rules of the animation in a @keyframes followed by the animation-name
  - In this case the rules are to be created in @keyframes cool{}
- 0% is what happens at the start of the 4 seconds and 100% is at the end
  - Thus in the above scenario we are telling the box to go from blue at 0s to green at 2s to yellow at 4s


THUS for an animation, write the properties under an id tag and then the rules under a @keyframes animation-name tag
