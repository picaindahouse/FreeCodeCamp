Lesson 10: Float and Clear

Float and Clear are also layout properties like position

FLOAT
The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.
The float property can have one of the following values:

left - The element floats to the left of its container
right - The element floats to the right of its container
none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent

- Say you have a paragraph that you wish to be displayed beside an image
  - You can apply float to either <p> or <img> to make this happen (maybe even to both)

CLEAR
The clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.
The clear property can have one of the following values:

none - Allows floating elements on both sides. This is default
left - No floating elements allowed on the left side
right- No floating elements allowed on the right side
both - No floating elements allowed on either the left or the right side
inherit - The element inherits the clear value of its parent

The most common way to use the clear property is after you have used a float property on an element.
