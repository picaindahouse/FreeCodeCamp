Lesson 7: Paragraphs and Line-Height
I'm pretty sure I know this but- you can use font-size on <p> and basically anything that has text init

Line-Height (can be used by anything with text in it as well) is how much height each line will have
eg:
p {line-height: 10px;}

- Once again unit can be absolute or relative but let's go with px for consistency
