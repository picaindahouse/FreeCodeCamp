Lesson 3: Bold, Underline, Italicize, Strikethrough

This lesson we will be learning about how to manipulate text to do the above
There are two ways to do this:
- Using style, this will apply the changes to the entire text
- Using tags to apply to specific words within the text

BOLD
- Specific:
For the tag methods, to bold certain parts of the text- use <strong> </strong>
eg:
<p>I want to go <strong>home</strong></p>
# Now home is bold, but the rest of the <p> isn't

- Style:
Add font-weight: bold; to the element
eg:
<style>
  p {font-weight:bold;}
</style>
# Now the entire <p> is bold

Extra:
font-weight can equate to alot of things:
-  normal, bold, bolder, lighter, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and inherit
- 100 is light all the way to 900 which is bold

UNDERLINE
- Specific:
For the tag methods, to underline certain parts of the text- use <u> </u>
eg:
<p>I want to go <u>home</u></p>
# Now home is underlined, but the rest of the <p> isn't

- Style:
Add text-decoration: underline; to the element
eg:
<style>
  p {text-decoration: underline;}
</style>
# Now the entire <p> is underlined

ITALICIZE
- Specific:
For the tag methods, to italicize certain parts of the text- use <em> </em>
eg:
<p>I want to go <em>home</em></p>
# Now home is italicized, but the rest of the <p> isn't

- Style:
Add font-style: italic; to the element
eg:
<style>
  p {font-style: italic;}
</style>
# Now the entire <p> is italicized

STRIKETHROUGH
- Specific:
For the tag methods, to bold certain parts of the text- use <s> </s>
eg:
<p>I want to go <s>home</s></p>
# Now home is strikethrough, but the rest of the <p> isn't

- Style:
Add text-decoration: line-through;; to the element
eg:
<style>
  p {text-decoration: line-through;}
</style>
# Now the entire <p> is strikethrough
