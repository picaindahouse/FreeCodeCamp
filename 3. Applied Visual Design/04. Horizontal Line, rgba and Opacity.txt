Lesson 4: Horizontal Line, rgba and Opacity

Joining three small things together:

Horizontal Lines:
<hr> is a self closing tag (means no </hr>) which draws a horizontal line across the page
- Use it to mark a thematic change or the start of a new section

rgba:
- I have used rgb in the past, rgba is basically rgb with another addition
- The a stands for alpha which basically means level of opacity
- 0 means transparent and 1 means opaque
- Anything in between will result in a translucent color

eg: rgba(45,45,45, 0.1) results in a translucent gray color
- Can be used as a background for text
- Basically, whenever you many need a translucent color

Opacity:
Since we already started talking about opacity
- Let's learn how to decrease an element's opacity

Simply add- opacity: 0.4;
- Where 0 is transparent and 1 is opaque

Eg of all three of the above:

<style>
  h1 {background-color: rgba(45,45,45,0.1);}
  h2 {color: white;
      background-color: black;
      opacity: 0.4;}
</style>
<html>
  <h1>I Hate You</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>He hates you too</h2>
</html>
