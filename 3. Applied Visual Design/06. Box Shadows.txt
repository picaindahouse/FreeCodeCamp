Lesson 6: Let's Create Box-Shadows

A box-shadow applies one or more shadows to an element
- Important to take note that often it is more than one shadow

The box-shadow takes 3 compulsory values and two optional:
- offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),
- offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),
- blur-radius,
- spread-radius and
- color

Must follow this order, but blur-radius and spread radius are optional

So, say:
box-shadow: 0px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
- Means offset-x, offset-y, color

box-shadow: 0px 5px 5px (rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
- Means offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, color

box-shadow: 0px 5px 5px 5px (rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
- Means offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius, color

Prob would have to mix-match until you get the desired outcome

To apply more than one shadow to the same element as alluded to before:
- Just add a comma in between:

box-shadow: 0px 5px 5px 5px (rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 5px 3px rgb(12,34,56);

Can have as many as you want
- Once again mix-match until you get your desired outcome.
