Lesson 2: Adjusting the Height and Width of an Element

To adjust an element's height or width we can use both absolute and relative units
- For this lesson we will just use an absolute unit (px)

Pretty simple, to the element just add:
width: 245px;
height: 25px;

However, this does not change the font-size or the size of the items in the element
- It only changes the size of the element itself

eg:
<style>
  h4 {width: 245px;}
  .red-box {height: 200px;}
</style>

- As you can see above, can be used in classes as well
