Lesson 11: Margin = "Auto" and Overlapping Elements

Will go through two unrelated things in this lesson

AUTO MARGIN
By equating margin to auto, the element automatically becomes centralised

<style>
  h1 {margin: auto:}
</style>
<h1>Hello World</h1>

- h1 in the above scenario will be in the center

OVERLAPPING ELEMENTS

Sometimes, two or more elements might overlap when you play around with the position: absolute/relative/etc
Two be able to decide the order of the overlap use z-index

Basically, give all overlapping elements a "z-index number" and the higher numbers will be on top 
In the scenario below first has a higher z-index (2) and thus will be on top of second who has a lower z-index number (1)
eg:<style>
  div {
    width: 60%;
    height: 200px;
    margin-top: 20px;
  }

  .first {
    background-color: red;
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 2;
  }
  .second {
    background-color: blue;
    position: absolute;
    left: 40px;
    top: 50px;
    z-index: 1;
  }
</style>

<div class="first"></div>
<div class="second"></div>
