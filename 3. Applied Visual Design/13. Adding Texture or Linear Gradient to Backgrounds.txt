<!--  Lesson 13: Adding Texture or Linear Gradient to Backgrounds
Have already tried to add the above to colors- does not work
The following only work for background: ________
To see how everything looks like, can convert this into HTML

LINEAR GRADIENT
- Linear Gradient takes two or more colors and goes from one to another
- To have a better idea, best to convert this into HTML 

Application:
background: linear-gradient(angle in deg, color 1, color2, ...);
- Can have as many colors as you want
- The angle is used to decide at what angle do you wish the colors to transition at
- Linear Gradient is used for body in the example below


REPEATING LINEAR GRADIENT
- Repeating Linear Gradient is the same as Linear Gradient just that as the name signifies, it repeats

Application: 
    background: repeating-linear-gradient(angle in deg, 
      color distance from left edge,
      color distance from left edge,
      so on and so forth- can have as many colors as you want);

- Understanding how the distance stuff works is crucial
  - Let's say yellow 0px, green 40px, purle 40px, red 80px
  - This means that it will start from yellow at the left most edge
  - Then transition over to green at 40px away from left edge
  - Then since purple is also at 40px, Green will end at 40px and purple will start at 40px
  - The purple will then slowly transition to red which is 80px
  - The whole thing will then repeat multiple times
- Used for the <p> background

TEXTURE
- Texture is pretty simple, find a texture you like online and copy the url
Then Application:
background: url(https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/imgr/MJAkxbh.png);
- Used for the <h1> element
-->

<style>
  body {background: linear-gradient(35deg, #CCFFFF,#FFCCCC);}
  p {background: repeating-linear-gradient(45deg, yellow 0px, green 40px, purple 40px, red 80px);}
  h1 {background: url(https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/imgr/MJAkxbh.png);}
</style>

<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p> I hate you, so lets go boom, yea </p>
