Lesson 8: Pseudo Classes
Psuedo Classes are used to define a special state of an element

Basically, what this means is that when something 'special' happens to an element
- You can make them react a certain way

For example, when the user's mouse hovers over the element you could change its color
- Something like the buttons I made in 'A Bit Racing'

A Pseudo Class looks something like this:
selector:pseudo-class {
  property:value;
}
- Where selector refers to the element
- The pseudo-class is the special thing happening to the element


Eg: (rmb a represents anchor- which anchors links to texts or imgs)
/* unvisited link- when a link has not been visited*/
a:link {
  color: #FF0000;
}

/* visited link- when a link has been visited */
a:visited {
  color: #00FF00;
}

/* mouse over link- to make the link change color*/
a:hover {
  color: #FF00FF;
}

/* selected link- to show that the link has been pressed, while waiting for it to load */
a:active {
  color: #0000FF;
}
