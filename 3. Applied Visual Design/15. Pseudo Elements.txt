Lesson 15: Pseudo Elements
Pseudo-elements are used to style specified parts of an element.
For example, they can be used to:
- Style the first letter, or line, of an element
- Insert content before, or after, the content of an element

A Pseudo Element looks something like this:
selector::pseudo-element {
  property:value;
}
- Where selector refers to the element
- The pseudo-element is the specified part of the element you wish to style

NOTE:
: is used for pseudo-class
:: is used for pseudo-element

There are five pseudo elements:
- ::before
  - Used to insert content before the content of an element
  - h1::before {content: url(smiley.gif)}
  - A smiley face before each h1 element

- ::after
  - Used to insert content after the content of an element

- ::first-letter
  - Used to style the first letter of a text
  - p::first-letter {
      color: #ff0000;
      font-size: xx-large;
    }

- ::first-line
  - Same as first-letter, just that instead of first letter style the first line

- ::selection
  - Selection basically lets you decide how an element will look when it has been highlighted
  - h1::selection{ color:red;
                   background: yellow;}
  - Now whenever a h1 content is highlighted, the font will turn red and the background yellow

That's All
