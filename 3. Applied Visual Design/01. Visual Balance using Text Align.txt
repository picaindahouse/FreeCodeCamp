Lesson 1: Text Alignment

Let us start with something simple- how to align text
There are four different ways one can align text:
- center
- left
- right
- justify

Since the first three should be quite obvious, let me explain what the last one does
- Justify causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.

How to apply:
To whichever element you wish to align just add the following:
text-align: center;

eg:
<style>
  h4 {text-align: center;}
  p  {text-align: justify;}
  h1 {text-align: left;}
  h2 {text-align: right;}
</style>
