Lesson 4: Adding Accessibility to Forms

Now we can know the reason for adding for and labels to our forms- it is to make it more readable for the user

Not only do radio and checkboxes get labels
- ALL form types are to get labels:

<form>
  <label for = "something">Whatever you want to call the Form</label>
  <input type= "whatever" id= "something" name= "something">
</form>

# Don't need to wrap the label as we had seen in the radio lesson
- since we are already using for, can just wrap the label around what you want to call the form

For radio buttons or checkboxes- add fieldset and legend:
- fieldset is a wrapper which groups all of the options to the same question together
- legend informs the user what you are choosing the options for
- rememeber to add a wrapper to each option

Eg:
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
    <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
    <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
    <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
    <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
    <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
    <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>

# All options have labels and there is also a legend
