Lesson 2: Header Hierachy and Importance of Tag Accuracy
Again combining two unrelated topics together

HEADER HIERACHY
- h1 to h6, have to be used in a hierachy with larger numbers beings subsections to larger ones
  - This help assitive tech to be able to distinguish the order of the page for their users
- h1 should only be used once to signify the main header

IMPORTANCE OF TAG ACCURACY
- Once again it is important to use the right tag for the right occasion
  - One could simply use <div> to replace everything: <footer>, <p>, <header>, <nav>, <section>, etc
- However, it is important to use the right tag to allow assistive tech to acces the information better 
and provide better page summary or navigation options to their users
- <main> element should be used only once and it should cover the main content of the page

Let's look at some of the following tags: <article>, <section>, <div>, <header>, <nav> and <footer>

ARTICLE
<article> is a new HTML5 element that is used to wrap independent, self-contained content.
- Works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles
- Whether a content can be an element is a judgement call but one should ask themselves this:
  - If you removed all surrounding context, would that content still make sense?

SECTION
<section> is also a new HTML5 element which is used to group things thematically:
- So that means sections ususally have a relationship with each other
- For example a book can be an <article> and the chapters would be <sections>

DIV
<div> is for when there is no thematic relationship between elements, but they cannot be standalone content

The following along with <main> have a landmark feature which let's assistive devices to quickly navigate to them

HEADER
<header> is used NOT as the title of the page 
- The best way to explain it would be to go to go to freecodecamp and look at the top where there is a dark blue element
which says freecodecamp in the middle and has a few links on the left: That is an example of a <header>

NAV
<nav> is used instead of a <div> when multiple links are put together 
- If the links are all at the bottom, don't use NAV just use footer
- An example would be a table of contents page with alot of links in it 

FOOTER
<footer> sits at the bottom of the page, usually with copyright information or links to related documents
