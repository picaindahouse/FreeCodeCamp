Lesson 8: Improve Accessibility of Audio Content

To learn how to improve accessibility we need to learn how to use audio elements

A general outlook:
<audio controls>
  <source src= "#" type= "audio/mpeg>
</audio>

# Audio is the element
# Add the attribute controls to be able to pause, start, skip the audio
# Source is a self closing element where we add the attributes src and type
# src gives the link to the audio and type informs the webpage what the audio actually is


IMPROVING ACCESSIBILITY

Methods will have to vary depending on what type of audio it is
- Music: Just add a text description explaining how it is a song by ____
- A Message: Text description that is a written version of the message


Basically find a method that tries to help those that cannot hear what the audio is saying
