Lesson 3: Figure Element and Access Key

Two unrelated things once again

FIGURE
You use <figure> to inform the screen reader that a visual representation (like an image or chart) is coming up
- Add <figcaption> to get a caption as well

eg:

<figure>
  <img src="roundhouseDestruction.jpeg" alt="Photo of Camper Cat executing a roundhouse kick">
  <br>
  <figcaption>
    Master Camper Cat demonstrates proper form of a roundhouse kick.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

# This would mean the screen reader would know a visual representation is coming up and the image will have a caption

ACCESS KEY

Keyboard shortcuts- basically you want to jump to a section of a website by just pressing a key on the keyboard
use access keys

- Works on all elements, simply:

<html>
  <h1 accesskey = "h">Hi<h1>
  <h2><a id="first" href="#" accesskey="g">The Garfield Files: Lasagna as Training Fuel?</a></h2>
</html>

- How this works is when you press h, you would go to the h1 and if you press g, you would go to the h2 element
