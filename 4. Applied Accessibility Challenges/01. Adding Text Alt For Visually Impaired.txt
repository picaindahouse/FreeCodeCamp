Lesson 1: Adding Text Alt for the Visually Impaired

Already learnt how to add alt before, I bring it up again because it is mandatory to add Alt in img in HTML5
- This is so that the screen reader can read the alt for the visually impaired
- Thus it is important for the alt to a proper description of the image

eg:
<img src= "#" alt= "A photo of a dog eating food">

However, since it is compulsory for there to be an alt- what happens when you don't need a description
- Maybe because the image is for decoration only or if there is already a caption
- Just have quotation marks but leave it black

eg:
<img src= "#" alt= "">
