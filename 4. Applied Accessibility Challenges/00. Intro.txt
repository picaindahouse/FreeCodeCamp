Lesson 0: Introduction to the Applied Accessibility Challenges

"Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, 
navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory,
mobility, or cognitive disabilities. Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless 
of a user's abilities or resources. Some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader 
or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a 
keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way 
towards creating an open web.
