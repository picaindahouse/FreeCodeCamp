Lesson 7: Tabindex

When you are a keyboard only user- you usually press tab to navigate through the website
However, tab by default only visits certain elements like links and inputs
  - What if you want it to visit an element that would not be visited by default?

Add tabindex = "0" to the element as an attribute:

<h1 tabindex = "0">Hey</h1>

- Now <h1> which is not an element that tab would visit by default will be visited by default

You can also have stuff like tabindex = "1", "2" BUT it is not recommended so that's that
