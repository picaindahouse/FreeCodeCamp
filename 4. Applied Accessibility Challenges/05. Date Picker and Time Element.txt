Lesson 5: Date Picker and Time Element

Continuing on from the forms theme of the last lesson, let us learn another form type
type= "date" let's users choose the date for the form

This is how everything will look like:

<form>
  <label for="input1">Enter a date:</label>
  <input type="date" id="input1" name="input1">
</form>

Some browsers are too old for date types and might just give a text field
- Best to have a placeholder for the text in these case to show how to type the date

TIME ELEMENT
Since, we are already talking about time- let us look at the time element

THIS DOES NOT ADD ANYTHING to the user experience for a normal user
- This, like a lot of other things in this chapter, is for a screen reader
  - Gives a standardized version of a time, even if it's written in an informal manner

To understand how it works, let us look at an example:
 <p>Master Camper Cat officiated the cage match between Goro and Scorpion 
<time datetime="2013-02-13">last Wednesday</time>, which ended in a draw.</p> 

# In the above example, to help a user that needs a screen reader- the informal manner that 
I have written "last Wednesday" will also be read as 2013-02-13 to avoid any confusion for 
such a user

# Thus to use time element- wrap an informal version of time with a more formal version:
<time datetime= "2020-02-03">Today</time>
