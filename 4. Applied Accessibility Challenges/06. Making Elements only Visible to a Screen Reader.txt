Lesson 6: Making Elements only Visible to a Screen Reader

Use CSS to hide things from a person who does not need a screen reader but not from those who do
- Eg: A Bar Chart, would need a table for a user who uses a screen reader
  - But while you would want the bar chart to be visible, you would not want the table to be seen

Can just use the following class to hide things:

<style>
  .sr-only {
    position: absolute;
    left: -10000px;
    width: 1px;
    height: 1px;
    top: auto;
    overflow: hidden;
  }
</style>

Then to the table itself:
# Add the class sr-only
# Also this is how you would create a table
<table class="sr-only">
      <caption>Hours of Weekly Training in Stealth, Combat, and Weapons</caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th scope="col">Stealth &amp; Agility</th>
          <th scope="col">Combat</th>
          <th scope="col">Weapons</th>
          <th scope="col">Total</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Week One</th>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>10</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Week Two</th>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>12</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Week Three</th>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>6</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>13</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
