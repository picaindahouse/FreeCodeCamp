# Lesson 17: Override!!!
In this lesson we will be looking at overriding
- To make things easier, I won't be commenting things out
- So this document cannot be turned into a HTML

A brief overview of the chain of power looks something like this:

!Important > Inline Style > id > Whichever class is declared last > Class > Inheritance

Let us start from the weakest and then go up:

- Inheritance

<style>
  body{color: green;}
</style>

<h1>Hello World</h1>

# In this scenario <h1> will be green in color since there is only inheritance as of now

- Class

<style>
  body{color: green;}
  .pink-text{color: pink;}
</style>

<h1 class= "pink-text">Hello World</h1>

# Classes override inheritance, thus <h1> will be pink in color and not green

- Hierachy within Classes

<style>
  body{color: green;}
  .pink-text{color: pink;}
  .blue-text{color: blue;}
</style>

<h1 class= "pink-text blue-text">Hello World</h1>

# CSS reads from the top to bottom and thus the hierachy favors the class it read last
# Thus the class which is written last is the one that will override the rest
# Therefore, <h1> will be blue- overriding both inheritance and the class that came before it

- id

<style>
  body{color: green;}
  .pink-text{color: pink;}
  .blue-text{color: blue;}
  #orange-text{color: orange;}
</style>

<h1 id = "orange-text" class= "pink-text blue-text">Hello World</h1>

# id overrides all classes and inheritance, it does not matter if it comes before or after the classes
# Thus, <h1> will be orange overriding all of the classes and inheritance so far

- Inline Style

<style>
  body{color: green;}
  .pink-text{color: pink;}
  .blue-text{color: blue;}
  #orange-text{color: orange;}
</style>

<h1 id = "orange-text" class= "pink-text blue-text" style = "color: white;">Hello World</h1>

# Inline style is when we add the style within the element- <h1 style = "color: white;"
# While this is not a preffered method to use to style- it overrides all of the prior methods
# Therefore, now <h1> is white

- !Important

<style>
  body{color: green !important;}
  .pink-text{color: pink;}
  .blue-text{color: blue;}
  #orange-text{color: orange;}
</style>

<h1 id = "orange-text" class= "pink-text blue-text" style = "color: white;">Hello World</h1>

# I added !important to the weakest of the colors based on the hierachy- green
# Since !important overrides ALL- <h1> is now green once again
# !important should be used when you need a certain css style to be applied at all costs

THEREFORE THIS IS THE HIERACHY!!!
