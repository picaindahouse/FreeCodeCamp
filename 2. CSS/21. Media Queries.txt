Lesson 21: Media Queries
Media queries is a CSS3 module allowing content rendering to adapt to conditions such as screen resolution. 

This basically means that you can set conditions which when met react differently
eg: If the screen is smaller than a certain size then all the sizes decrease

How to apply:
@media(condition){What happens when condition is met}

eg:
<style>
  :root {
    --penguin-size: 300px;
    --penguin-skin: gray;}

  @media (max-width: 350px) {
    :root {
      --penguin-size: 200px;
      --penguin-skin: black;
    }
</style>

Basically, what happens is if the screens width is <= 350px then:
- penguin-size: 200px
- penguin-skin: black

If not:
- penguin-size: 300px
- penguin-skin: gray

And that is it for CSS!!!
