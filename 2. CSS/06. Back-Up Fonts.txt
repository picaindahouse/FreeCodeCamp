<!-- Lesson 6: Back-Up Fonts
When you get fonts from Google Fonts, you need a back-up font
- This is in case of a scenario, where for whatever reason the browser cannot find you imported font
- In this case you need a backup font, a default font at that

To do this, whenever you equate a font-family to an imported font
- After writing the imported font
- Do not ; but rather , default font;

As such:
h2 {font-family: Lobster, monospace;}

Often Google Fonts give suggestions for good back-up fonts
-->

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, monospace;
  }

  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
