<!-- Lesson 3: Using style with Class
In this lesson we learn how to use a Class with style

Basically create a class by calling it ".something" and then equate it to something

An example:
<style>
  .red-text{color:red;}
</style>

- This would mean that we have created a class called red-text
- When this is applied to a tag, it will change the color of the text in that tag to red
- Can be used in more than one tag

Below I use the class I created above in a paragraph and a h2:
-->

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
</main>
