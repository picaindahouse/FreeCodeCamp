<!-- Lesson 15: Absolute VS Relative Units
So far we have used px as the main unit
- px is an absolute unit
- Other absolute units you can use are in (inch), mm (milimeter) 


However, one can also use relative units
- These are units who dictate an objects size based on another property of the object
- For example em is a unit which is based on the size of the element's font

We will learn more under another chapter in the future
