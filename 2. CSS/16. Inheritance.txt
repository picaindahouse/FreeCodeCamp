# Lesson 16: Inheritance
In this lesson we will be looking at inheritance
- To make things easier, I won't be commenting things out
- So this document cannot be turned into a HTML

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hey</h1>
    <p>I went home yesterday, I have been lost since then</p>
  </body>
</html>

- To style the above html, what if I did something like this:

<style>

  body {color: green;
        font-size: 15px;
        font-family: monospace;}

</style>

- Now the style has only be applied to the <body> but since <h1> and <p> are technically part of the <body> 
will this style also be applied to them

- Unless the style applied to the <body> is overrided, the style applied to <body> will also be applied to <h1> and <p>
  - Next lesson will go into what overrides what

- This is called style inheritance, unless overridden- an element within another element will inherit the latter elements style
