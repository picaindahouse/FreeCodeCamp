<!-- Lesson 11: id of an Element
We have already used id before when learning how to create links to segments in the same page
- Basically id of an element basically acts like a way to identify a specific element
- Thus an id of an element has to be unique to just that element

How to set an id of an element:
- Simply add the attribute id = "Unique-name"
- Same as in the linking lesson

Uses of an id to Style
- What id does is to allow us to specifically style just one element
- When we use <p>, we style all of the <p>
- However, when you style #Unique-name from <p id = "Unique-name" you are just styling that specific <p> element
- Instead of .class that we use for class
  - When you wish to style an id- start with #
  - This can be seen below where I style #cat-photo-form
  - Where cat-photo-form is the id of the form
--> 

<style>

  #cat-photo-form {background-color: green;}

</style>

<main>
   <form action="/submit-cat-photo" id="cat-photo-form">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Loving</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label><br>
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>
