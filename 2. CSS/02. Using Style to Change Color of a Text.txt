<!-- Lesson 2: Using Style to Change Color
This lesson will look at the second way to implement CSS to a HTML
- Add <style> to the top of the page and add the changes you want over there

Let us try to change the color of the h2 text to blue via this method:
<style>
  h2 {color: blue;}
</style>

- Write what you want to change in {}
- Still put ; after blue

So overall you it should look something like this:
-->

<style>
  h2 {color: blue;}
</style>
