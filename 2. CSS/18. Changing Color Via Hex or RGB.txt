<!- Lesson 18: Changing Color Via Hex or RGB

Till now we have added color to text or background by just writing the color we want them to be 
eg: h1 {color: black;}

However, this limits us in the choice of colors we have to choose from
- There are two ways to add color which give us far more variety

HEX: 6 numbers of digits or letters, lowest 0 largest F
eg: black- #000000 (first two numbers r, then next two blue, last two green)

h1 {color: #000000;}

- If you want to shorten the code, there is also abbreviated HEX, just three digits one each for RGB

h1 {color: #F0F;)

RGB: Have used before in pygames, thus should have no need for an explanation

h1 {color: rgb(004, 123, 143);}

Two find out what the HEX or RGB code of a color is- just search online
Prob best to use RGB since I already have quite a bit of experience with it
