# Lesson 0: Intro to Basic CSS

CSS is a way to design your website

Three ways to apply CSS styling:
1) Can apply inline styles directly to HTML attributes
- Considered the worst method

2) Can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document
- We will be working in this method for majority of this chapter

3) Write CSS rules in an external style sheet
- Considered Best Method
- Keeps the styles seperate from HTML elements
- Improves readability and reusability of your code
