<!-- Lesson 1: Changing the Color of Text
In this lesson, for the first and last time, we will be using the first way to style using CSS

To use CSS via the first method- we simply add the style attribute to whichever tag we wish to change:
- Say for example we want a h2 element to be red in color
- We add the attribute: style = "color: red;" to the h2 tag
- It is important to have the semicolon after the color

The first method is often discouraged as it makes the script harder to read and reuse

<h2 style = "color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
