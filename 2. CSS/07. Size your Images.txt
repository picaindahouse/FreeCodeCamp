<!-- Lesson 7: Size your Images

CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts,
we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.

We can use class or style to size images, but in this case let us go with class
- Probably better to go with class for size of img, or all img will have the same size

Below you can see me sizing the cat image to have a width of 100px
- The height of the image is also altered proportionately
-->

<style>

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;}

</style>


<main>

  <a href="#"><img class= "smaller-image" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

</main>
