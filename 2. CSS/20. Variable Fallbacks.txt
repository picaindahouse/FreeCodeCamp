Lesson 20: Variable Fallbacks
As you can see everything in HTML and CSS has a back-up

A Simple Backup works while using the variable:
<style>
  :root {--tom: red;}
  h1: {color: var(--tom, red);}
</style>

- As you can see above you add the back-up to the braket after var: var(--variable, back-up)

A Back-Up for Browsers:
- Certain browsers for whatever reason are unable to read variables
- For these browsers we need to have a different type of back-up:
<style>
  :root {--tom: red;}
  h1: {color: red;
       color: var(--tom, red);}
</style>

- As you can see above we have created a color style before the color style where we use the variable
- This is because CSS reads top to bottom and thus will apply what came last
- Therefore, should the browser be able to read the variable- it will follow the latter, if it can't then it 
will follow the former
