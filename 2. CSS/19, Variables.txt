Lesson 19: Variables
Variables are used to define certain things
eg: --pencolor: blue;

Now we can use the variable pencolor multiple times, knowing that it equals blue
- This is beneficial since when one wants to change the value of pencolor, we can just change the variables value
instead of having to change the color blue multiple times

Creating a Variable:
I have already showed it above, but basically have to put -- before the variable
eg: --tom: red;
- Now we have a variable called tom

Using a Variable
Simply, equate it to var(--variable)

Eg:
<style>
  :root {--tom: red;}
  h1 {color: var(--tom);}
</style>
<html>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</html>

- As you can see above, the variable tom basically represents red and has been applied to the h1 element

:root:
:root is usually where you put all of your variables in as it allows all the variables inside to be Global Variables
- This means that they can be used in all of the elements

However, should you want a variable to be specific- just create it inside the element
eg: 
<style>
  h1 {--tom: red;
      color: var(--tom);}
</style>
