<!-- Lesson 4: Set Font Size and Family
Now we will learn how to change font size and font family

Just like we change the color to change size:

<style>
  p {font-size: 16px;}
</style>

- This makes the font size of all paragraphs to 16 

To change font family (basically the font)

<style>
  p {
     font-size: 16px;
     font-family: monospace;}
</style>

- Now the font of all paragraphs is changed to monospace
- Can have more than one changes in the same {}, that is why you use ;
-->

<style>
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;}
</style>
