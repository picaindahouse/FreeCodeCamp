 <!-- Lesson 12: Padding and Margins of an Element
- In this lesson we will be learning about paddings and margins

Padding of an Element
- An element's padding is essentially the space between the element's content and it's border
- Thus increasing the padding will essentially make the content smaller
- Adjust it using pixels, eg- padding: 20px

Margin of an Element
- An element's margin is the space between the element's border and other elements
- Thus increasing the margin will make the content look smaller
- Adjust it using pixels, eg- margin: 20px
- A negative margin will make the element even bigger

As you can see below with the blue and red boxes, you have to experiment around with padding and margin
- Until you find the design you like best
-->

<style>
  .red-box {
    background-color: crimson;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 20px;
  }

  .blue-box {
    background-color: blue;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: -10px;
  }
</style>
<h5 class="injected-text">margin</h5>

<div class="box yellow-box">
  <h5 class="box red-box">padding</h5>
  <h5 class="box blue-box">padding</h5>
</div>
