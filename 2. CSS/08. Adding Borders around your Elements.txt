<!-- Lesson 8: Adding Borders around your Elements

To create a basic border around your elementsm there are three things to look at
- border-color
- border-width
- border-style

Specify the above three things and you can apply a border to anything

Below we create a class that adds a thick green border to elements
- As you can see I have specified all three things mentioned above
- I then add it to the img we just resized

You can have more than one class applied to the same element
- class = "class-A Class-B"
- Just seperate them with a space as seen below
-->

<style>
  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
  }

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>

<main>
 
  <a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

</main>
