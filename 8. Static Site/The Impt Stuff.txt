# Just the impt stuff
1) Link to .css from .html (under <head>):
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">

2) Ensure that all you content in a html file is under a <div class = "container"> 
- Prob best to give ids to most stuff as well, eg sections
- So that all your content follows the same layout
- Give elements that require special layouts, personal classes or ids

eg:
    <header>
        <div class="container">
            <div id = "title">
                <h1>My First Website</h1>
            </div>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
                    <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
                    <li><a href="services.html">Services</a></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </div>
    </header>

- both <nav> and <h1> are under a <div class="container">, but since I wish to style h1 further
  - h1 is under id = "title" as well
