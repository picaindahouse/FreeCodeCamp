# Step 1
- Create folder
- Turn it into a git repo
- Create index.html (main page)
- Create two folders within (img and css)
- Create a style.css in css folder (all our design will be added in there


Open index.html
- Add all of the <meta>, <link> and <title> under <head>

Just copy from here if needed:

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="Learning how to make a simple static site">
    <meta name="keywords" content="First, New, How to make a website">
    <meta name="author" content="Utkarsh">
    <title>My First Website | Welcome</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">
</head>

# Use the link to connect style.css to index.html
# The rest of the meta tags are not very important as of now- only the viewport one is necessary
