Lesson 1.2: Rows and Columns

CSS Grid works in two dimensions
  - Thus the container is split into rows and columns which can be manipulated at the same time
    - Column: Vertical lines of the grid items
    - Row: Horizontal lines of the grid items

You can adjust the gaps between rows and columns using the following properties:

1) grid-column-gap

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 grid-column-gap: 50px;}

2) grid-row-gap

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 grid-row-gap: 50px;}

3) grid-gap

- Shorthand for the above two, column first then row

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 grid-gap: 50px 100px;}

- Can be used to set the same value for both as well:

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 grid-gap: 50px;}

- Now both row and column gaps are 50px
