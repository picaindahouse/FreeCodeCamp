Lesson 3.8: Justify Self and Align Self

- Basically justify self is justify items specifically for an individual item (overides justify content)
- Same for align self and align items

Justify self and align self are default set to stretch but can also be one of the following:

1) center

2) start

3) end

# How the above work should be understood as it has been covered in both justify content and align content
