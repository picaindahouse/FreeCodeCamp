Lesson 1.1: CSS Grid 101

Just like flexbox Grid to has parent and child elements
- However to differentiate between the two:
  - Parent will be called container 
  - Child will be called item

To initiate grid have to name display either grid or inline grid:

.grid-container {display: grid;}  OR

.grid-container {display: inline-grid;}
