Lesson 4: Items vs Content vs Self

Justify Content is the alignment of the Grid Horizontally
- Thus the whole grid will align to the center if justify-content: center;

Align Content is the alignment of the Grid Verically

Justify Items is the alignment of the content within the items Horizontally
- Therefore, all the items' content will be aligned in the center of their respective items
- However, the grid itself will remain unchanged

Align Items is the alignment of the content within the items Vertically

Justify self and Align self override Justify Items and Align Items respectively
