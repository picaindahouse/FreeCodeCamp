Lesson 1.3: Row Lines and Column Lines

Row lines are the lines between rows and thus by that logic column lines are lines between columns
- The first lines and the last lines are the boundaries
- When placing a grid item in a grid container, can specify the exact spot it is supposed to go into using the lines:

.item1 {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: 3;
}

- Thus it will be between the first column line and the third one

- Can use row-start and row-end along with the above to really set the boundaries of grid items

Don't need to worry to much about this- will learn more about this when we learn the shorthands over the next three chapters
