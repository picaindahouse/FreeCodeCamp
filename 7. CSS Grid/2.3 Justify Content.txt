Lesson 2.3: Justify Content

justify-content property is used to align the whole grid inside the container
- The grid's total width has to be less than the container's width for the justify-content property to have any effect
- This means that the column width cannot exceed that of the containers
- Can just adjust the width of the container to allow for this

A few options for justify-content: 
- Same as justify-content in flexbox

1) Space Evenly

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 justify-content: space-evenly;}

# Gives the columns equal amount of space between, and around them

2) Space Around

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 justify-content: space-around;}

# Gives the columns equal amount of space around them

3) Space Between

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 justify-content: space-between;}

# Gives the columns equal amount of space between them

4) Center

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 justify-content: center;}

# Aligns the grid in the middle of the container

5) Start

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 justify-content: start;}

# Aligns the grid to the beginning of the container (left)

6) End

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 justify-content: end;}

# Aligns the grid to the end of the container (right)
