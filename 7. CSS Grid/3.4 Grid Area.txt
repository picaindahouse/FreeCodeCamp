Lesson 3.4: Grid Area

A shorthand for a shorthand- that is what grid-area is a shorthand for grid-row and grid-column which are already shorthands

grid-area: row-start/ column-start/ row-end/ column-end;

Same as always, two ways to do it:

1) Without span

.item1 {
  grid-area: 1 / 2 / 5 / 6;
}

# item1 will start on row 1 and end before row 5
# item1 will start on column 1 and end before column 6

2) With span

.item1 {
  grid-area: 2 / 1 / span 2 / span 3;
}

# item1 will start on row 2 and span 2 rows
# item1 will start on column 2 and span 3 columns

Still have not ended- still got naming left
