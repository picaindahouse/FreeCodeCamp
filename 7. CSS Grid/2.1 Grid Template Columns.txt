Lesson 2.1: Grid Template Column

- The grid-template-column property defines the number of columns in your grid layout and the width of each layout
- It will become clearer via the following example

Eg 1: Say you want there to be 4 columns with the first two having a width of 50px, and the last two having a width of 60px

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 60px 60px;
}

Eg 2: Should you wish to have three columns all with the same width

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
}

# Whenever, you have a few columns with specified width and you wish for the rest to adjust accordingly, use auto for the 
  non specified columns
