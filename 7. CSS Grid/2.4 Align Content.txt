Lesson 2.4: Align Content

align-content property is used to vertically align the whole grid inside the container
justify-content property is used to align the whole grid inside the container
- The grid's total height has to be less than the container's height for the align-content property to have any effect
- This means that the row height cannot exceed that of the containers
- Can just adjust the height of the container to allow for this

A few options for align-content: 
- Same as align-content in flexbox

1) Center

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 align-content: center;}

# Aligns the grid in the middle of the container

2) Space Evenly

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 align-content:space-evenly;}

# Gives the rows equal amount of space between, and around them

3) Space Around

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 align-content:space-around;}

# Gives the rows equal amount of space around them

4) Space Between

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 align-content:space-between;}

# Gives the rows equal amount of space between them


5) Start 

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 align-content: start;}

# Aligns the grid to the beginning of the container (top)

6) End

.grid-container {display: grid;
                 align-content: end;}

# Aligns the grid to the end of the container (bottom)
