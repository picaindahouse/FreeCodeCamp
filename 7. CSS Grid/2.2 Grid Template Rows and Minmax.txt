Lesson 2.2: Grid Template Rows and Minmax

- The grid-template-row property defines the number of rows in your grid layout and the height of each layout
- It will become clearer via the following example

Eg 1: Say you want there to be 4 rows with the first two having a height of 50px, and the last two having a height of 60px

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 60px 60px;
}

Eg 2: Should you wish to have three rows all with the same height

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: auto auto auto;
}

# Whenever, you have a few rows with specified height and you wish for the rest to adjust accordingly, use auto for the 
  non specified rows


MINMAX

Basically can use the minmax to determine how small or large an item can get
- Used with grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns

Therefore, in the following example, the max the second row can be is 100px and the min is 50px

grid-template-rows: 100px minmax(50px, 100px);

minmax (min, max)
