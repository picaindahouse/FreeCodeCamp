Lesson 3.2: Grid Column

- The grid-column property defines which columns to place an item in
- Shorthand for column start and column end

Two ways:

1) Without span

.item1 {
  grid-column: 1 / 5;
}

# Item starts in the 1st column and ends BEFORE the 5th column

2) With span

.item1 {
  grid-column: 1 / span 3;
}

# Item starts in the 1st column and spans 3 column
