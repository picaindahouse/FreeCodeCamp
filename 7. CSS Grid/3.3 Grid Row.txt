Lesson 3.2: Grid Row

- The grid-row property defines which rows to place an item in
- Shorthand for row start and row end

Two ways:

1) Without span

.item1 {
  grid-row: 1 / 5;
}

# Item starts in the 1st row and ends BEFORE the 5th row

2) With span

.item1 {
  grid-column: 1 / span 3;
}

# Item starts in the 1st row and spans 3 row
