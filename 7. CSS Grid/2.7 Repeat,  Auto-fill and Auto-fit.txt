Lesson 2.7: Repeat, Auto-fill and Auto-fit

REPEAT

Basically you can use the repeat function when you intend to repeat a certain value multiple times:
eg:

grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 50px 50px;

# can also be written as:

grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 50px);

# Thus, it works like this- repeat(no. of times, the value)


AUTO-FILL

auto-fill is an option that comes with repeat.
- It allows you to automatically insert as many rows or columns of your desired size as possible
  - Depends on the size of the contained

eg:
repeat(auto-fill, 60px);

This setup keeps inserting 60px columns and stretching them until it can insert another one in

AUTO-FIT

auto-fit is another option that comes with repeat which is very similar to auto-fill
  - However, where auto-fill keeps on inserting more columns when the size of the contained exceeds the number of columns,
    auto-fit stretches all of the existing columns to fit the size of the container

eg:
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, 60px);
