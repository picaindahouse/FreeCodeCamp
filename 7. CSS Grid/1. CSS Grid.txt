Lesson 1: CSS Grid

- CSS Grid helps you easily build complex web designs

- It works by turning an HTML element into a grid container with rows and columns for you to place 
  children elements where you want within a grid\

- Basically a more complicated but thus more powerful version of flexbox

- Where flexbox usually works in one dimensions CSS Grid works in 2 dimensions working with both rows and columns simultaneously
